    This is an example file which overrides some defaults from the application configuration.
    To enable this file, remove the '.example' extension from the file name.
    
    ### IMPORTANT ###
    
    Configuration files are loaded in the following order
      1) Files are loaded from appplicationPath/config/sitecore
      2) Files are loaded from hostPath/config/global (if it exists)
      3) Files are loaded from hostPath/config/{environment} (if it exists)
      
    applicationPath is the installation path of the application
    hostPath is the current working directory when the application is executed.
    
    The following files are accepted for configuration:
      - Xml
      - Json
      - Ini
    
    NOTE: Files must be prefixed with 'sc.' to be loaded.
    
    
    Overriding Values:
    
      Values from configuration files can be overridden simply by declaring them again.
      To add new settings, simple declare them in the xml.
      
      
    Key Redirects:
    
      Configuration elements can point to other configuration values using the following syntax:
    
      If we have a config of
        <Settings>
          <Sitecore>
            <Publishing>
              <ConnectionStrings>
                <Master>user id=sa;password=password;data source=.\SQLEXPRESS;database=sitecore.Master;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;</Master>
              </ConnectionStrings>
            </Publishing>
            </Sitecore
        </Settings>
      
      We can point another configuration element to the same value using
        ${Sitecore:Publishing:ConnectionStrings:Master}
    
      NOTE: 
        The path must be defined using ':' between each node name.
        The full value must start with '${' and end with '}'
